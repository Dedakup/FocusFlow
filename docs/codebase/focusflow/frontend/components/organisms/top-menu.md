# Top menu

This component includes the following functionality and components:

* **Logo**: Positioned in the top left corner. It functions as a link to the main page when clicked, similar to YouTube's behavior.
* **Links**: Located in the top center section, providing navigation to the high-level pages of the app.
* **Top Right Section**: Contains a notification box and the user's avatar. Clicking the avatar opens a dropdown menu with options to manage the account, navigate to user-specific pages, and configure settings.
* **Auto-Hide Behavior**: When the user is on the dashboard, the links and the top-right section (notification box and user avatar) should automatically hide after 1.5 seconds.
* **State Management**: Similar to the bottom menu, all state and functionality should be managed using Redux for state communication and custom hooks for implementing logic.
